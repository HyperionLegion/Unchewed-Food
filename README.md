# Unchewed-Food
Our innovative product is a mobile application aimed to prevent food waste in both households and markets. Unchewed Food best connects the agriculture industry to modern technology such as Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Starting from households, our application will track a householdâ€™s inventory of food through receipts, pictures, manual input, etc. With this data, the app can then remind users when their food is about to expire. Along with reminders, the app suggests recipes using available ingredients that likely appeal to the house according to previous meals made. When a family goes to dispose of excess food, they simply take a picture of the food they throw out to record how much and of what product they waste. With enough data, the app can then recommend the amount for each food item the next time they go shopping. It can also offer options to order discounted items online from salvage stores, especially items they frequently buy and use quickly. Furthermore, with their purchasing data, Unchewed Food can provide key insights into predicting the supply needed according to demand. This will help stores better estimate how much of each product to buy so that they capitalize on profits while preventing excessive food waste. Any foods that are about to expire can be offered by the store at a discounted price for consumers using Unchewed Food that are looking for cheaper ingredients.
